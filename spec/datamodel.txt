The data model of GraphPaper is, of course, the interesting part. Understanding
how GraphPaper thinks is essential for understanding how it is designed and
how to use it.

There are two major components: the card and the edge. There are a number of
other supporting data types as well.

--Card--

The main attributes of a card are its title and text. It also has a position in
the workspace and a size, both in viewport-independent coordinates. Any
component of the position can be negative. It also has a creation date and last-
modified date. It has an ID chosen by sqlite.

--Edge--

Each edge has an origin card, destination card, and type. It also has an ID
chosen by sqlite.

--Edge Type--

Edge types are distinct objects. It mostly contains an id and name, but also
contains the styles used for the edge, though it's possible this is beyond
the purview of the basic lib.

Edge types are referenced by the user by their names.

There is also a table of configuration values, with a key-value pair in each
row.
