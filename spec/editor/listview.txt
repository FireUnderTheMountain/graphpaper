List view is an optional mode that shows all cards in a list. This allows
the user to keep track of cards that are hidden or far off the beaten path
of the workspace, so nothing gets lost.

It is activated by a view menu entry or a keyboard shortcut. It shows up as a
sidebar on the left side of the window that can be expanded or shrunk.

It contains a tree-type control with the top level being a list of all cards
in the workspace. All that is shown is the title or a preview. The entry is
dimmed if the card is hidden, but only slightly.

When each entry is expanded, it shows:
 * card text.
 * outgoing edges
 * incoming edges

Edges are also shown dimly if they are hidden.

The card text can be edited, perhaps in a dialog.

The edge entries contain, and facilitate editing:
 * edge type
 * the other end of the edge ("origin" or "destination" depending). These
should be made to appear like links, and take you to the list entry of the card.
